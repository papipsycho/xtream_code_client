void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await XtreamCode.initialize(
    baseUrl: 'https://your-xtream-codes-api-url',
    username: 'your-username',

final client = XtreamCode.instance.client;
```

Now you can use the client to interact with the Xtream Codes API.

### Functionality

```dart
// Instantiate the XtreamCodeClient
var client = XtreamCodeClient(baseUrl, streamUrl, http);

// Call serverInformation
var serverInfo = await client.serverInformation();

// Call liveStreamCategories
var liveStreamCategories = await client.liveStreamCategories();

// Call vodCategories
var vodCategories = await client.vodCategories();

// Call seriesCategories
var seriesCategories = await client.seriesCategories();

// Call livestreamItems with a category
var liveStreamItems = await client.livestreamItems(category: liveStreamCategories.first);

// Call vodItems with a category
var vodItems = await client.vodItems(category: vodCategories.first);

// Call vodInfo with a VOD item
var vodInfo = await client.vodInfo(vodItems.first);

// Call seriesItems with a category
var seriesItems = await client.seriesItems(category: seriesCategories.first);

// Call seriesInfo with a series item
var seriesInfo = await client.seriesInfo(seriesItems.first);

// Load the complete EPG table in the format of XMLTV. 
// This is much faster than the other 2 following options that only load it for a single channel
var epgTable = await client.epg();

// Call channelEpg with a live stream item and a limit
var channelEpg = await client.channelEpg(liveStreamItems.first, 10);

// Call channelEpgTable with a live stream item
var channelEpgTable = await client.channelEpgTable(liveStreamItems.first);
```
